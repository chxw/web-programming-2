## Naming
Torvalds sarcastically quipped about the name git (which means "unpleasant person" in [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English) slang): "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'." The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker". The read-me file of the source code elaborates further:

"git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.

* Random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
* Stupid. Contemptible and despicable. Simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
* "Global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
* "Goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks.
